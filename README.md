# WebServer

A multi-threaded (e.g. file-based) web server with thread-pooling implemented in Java. **This repository is a fork from [ibogomolov/WebServer](https://github.com/ibogomolov/WebServer).**  I extended this project and documented the code.  

---

## I have done the following changes  

- Documented the code.  
- Created a license (MIT-license)  
- Verification of the command-line arguments in the main(...)-method. Checks whether the command-line arguments are in the proper form. Otherwise it raise a certain error-message.
